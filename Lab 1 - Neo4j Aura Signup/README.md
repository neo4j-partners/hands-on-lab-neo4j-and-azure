**Step 9: Choose HTTPS Connection (if the default connection method fails)**

First, try connecting using the 'neo4j+s' protocol, which typically offers better performance. If the system doesn't respond for an extended period or errors out, click the 'v' dropdown under 'Connection Method' and select 'https://'. The HTTPS option uses port 443 and can help if other port (7687) are blocked by your corporate network security policies.
