# Making Retrievers Conversational

---

## Introduction

Now that you understand the three types of retrievers, let's learn how to make them **conversational** by wrapping them as *agent* tools.

---

## Agents = Retrievers + Conversation Framework

**What is an Agent?**

An agent is a conversational wrapper around retrievers:

- **Schema Retriever** → Database Schema Tool
- **Vector + Cypher Retriever** → Hybrid Tool
- **Text2Cypher Retriever** → Structured Query Tool

**The agent adds:**

- User query analysis
- Natural language conversation interface
- Automatic tool selection based on question type
- Flexible context management

---

## Agent Intelligence: Tool Selection

**The agent's job is to choose the right retriever tool:**

- **"How are Products related to other entities?"** → Use Schema for data model exploration
- **"Which companies are affected by banking regulations?"** → Use Vector+Cypher for contextual relationships
- **"What risks does Apple face?"** → Use Text2Cypher for precise company data

---

## Agent Intelligence: Agent Reasoning

**Agent reasoning:**

1. Analyze the user's question
2. Determine what type of information is needed
3. Select the appropriate retriever tool
4. Execute the tool and format the response
5. Maintain conversation context

---

## Progressive Learning Path

**You'll build the agent incrementally:**

**First Agent:** Basic agent with **schema introspection** tool

- Start simple with database exploration
- Learn agent fundamentals

**Enhanced Agent:** Add **document retrieval** tool

- Add semantic search with graph context
- Compare tool behaviors

**Complete Agent:** Add **text-to-Cypher** tool

- Add structured queries
- Multi-tool agent intelligence

Each step adds one more tool - building complexity step by step.

**The retrievers do the heavy lifting - the agent makes them conversational and smart about when to use each one.**

---

## Getting Started

In the next lessons, you'll progressively build an agent by adding retriever tools one by one:

1. **Schema tool** for data model exploration
2. **Vector + Cypher tool** for semantic exploration and contextual relationships
3. **Text2Cypher tool** for precise queries

Each lesson shows how to wrap a retriever as a tool and how the agent chooses between available tools.

---

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that agents are **conversational wrappers** around the retrievers you already know:

**Key Concept:**

- **Retrievers** = The core functionality (Schema, Vector+Cypher, Text2Cypher)
- **Agents** = Conversational interface + intelligent tool selection
- **Tools** = Retrievers wrapped for agent use

**What Agents Add:**

- User query analysis
- Natural language conversation interface
- Automatic tool selection based on question type
- Flexible context management

**Progressive Learning:**

- **First Agent:** Schema tool → Database exploration
- **Enhanced Agent:** Add document retrieval → Semantic search with context
- **Complete Agent:** Add text2cypher → Structured queries

**The retrievers do the work - the agent makes them conversational and intelligent about when to use each one.**

In the next lesson, you will start building your agent with schema introspection as your first tool.
