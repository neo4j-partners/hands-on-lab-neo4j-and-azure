# Congratulations!

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the **Agents** module of the Neo4j & Generative AI Hands-On Workshop. 🎉

Throughout this module, you've learned how to build conversational agents that leverage Neo4j's graph capabilities to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Let's take a moment to reflect on what you've accomplished.

## What You've Accomplished

### Understanding Agents

You now understand:

* **What agents are** - Conversational wrappers around retrievers that analyze user queries and select appropriate tools
* **Agent architecture** - How agents combine retrievers with conversation frameworks to create interactive systems
* **The ReAct framework** - How agents use reasoning and acting cycles to process queries and generate responses

### Building Agents with Microsoft Agent Framework

You've learned how to:

* **Create agents using Microsoft Agent Framework** - Build conversational agents that integrate with Neo4j
* **Integrate multiple retrievers** - Combine schema, vector + Cypher, and text-to-Cypher retrievers as agent tools
* **Configure agent behavior** - Set up agents with appropriate prompts and tool descriptions
* **Handle agent responses** - Process and display agent outputs in conversational interfaces

### Working with Aura Agents

You've explored:

* **No-code agent creation** - Build agents through Neo4j Aura's web interface
* **Agent tool types** - Similarity Search, Cypher Template, and Text-to-Cypher tools
* **Agent configuration** - Set up agents with names, descriptions, and prompt instructions
* **Testing and deployment** - Test agents through the Aura interface and make them available via API

### Additional Resources

## Summary

Congratulations on completing the **Generative AI Hands-On Workshop**!

You've learned how to build conversational agents that leverage Neo4j's graph capabilities, integrated multiple retriever types as agent tools, and explored both code-based and no-code approaches to agent creation. You're now ready to build your own intelligent conversational applications with Neo4j and GraphRAG.
