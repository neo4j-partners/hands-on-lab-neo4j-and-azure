# Module 2: Retrievers

Welcome to Module 2 of the Neo4j Generative AI workshop! This module introduces you to different types of retrievers that enable intelligent information retrieval from knowledge graphs.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will:

- Understand GraphRAG and how it enhances traditional RAG approaches
- Learn about three types of retrievers: Vector, Vector + Cypher, and Text2Cypher
- Explore the strengths and use cases for each retriever type
- Set up your development environment for hands-on practice
- Work with retrievers in Jupyter notebooks to see how they perform with different query types
- Compare retriever behaviors and understand when to use each approach
