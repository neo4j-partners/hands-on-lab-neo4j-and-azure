# All Three Tools

## Introduction

You will complete your agent by adding a Text2Cypher query tool as the third tool.

The agent automatically chooses the best tool for each question type:

**Schema Tool:**

- Understanding database structure
- _"What entities exist in the graph?"_

**Document Retrieval Tool:**

- Finding content with company context
- _"What products does Microsoft mention in its documents?"_

**Database Query Tool:**

- Precise queries and counts
- _"How many risk factors does Apple face?"_
- _"What stock has Microsoft issued?"_

## The Final Tool

Open the notebook: `02_03_text2cypher_agent.ipynb`

**Your complete agent will now have:**

- **Tool 1:** Schema Tool (database structure exploration)
- **Tool 2:** Document Retrieval Tool (vector search + graph context)
- **Tool 3:** Database Query Tool (text-to-Cypher for precise queries) ← **NEW!**

This creates a comprehensive GraphRAG agent that can handle any type of question intelligently.

## Try These Questions

**Try these questions to see all three tools in action:**

- _"What products does Microsoft mention in its financial documents?"_
- _"How many risk factors does Apple face and what are the top ones?"_
- _"What stock has Microsoft issued?"_
- _"What are the main risk factors mentioned in the documents?"_
- _"Summarize Apple's risk factors and how they relate to other companies"_

The agent will choose from the 3 tools available:

- Graph Exploration (Schema Tool)
- Contextual Search (Vector + Cypher Tool)
- Precise Queries (Text2Cypher Tool)

**Notice:** The agent intelligently selects the right tool(s) for each question type! Complex questions may invoke multiple tools.

## Summary

In this lesson, you completed your GraphRAG agent by adding the Text2Cypher Retriever as the third tool:

**Key Concepts:**

- **Complete tool suite:** All three retrievers now available as conversational tools
- **Intelligent routing:** Agent automatically selects best tool(s) for each question
- **Progressive capability:** From simple search to complex multi-tool reasoning

**What You Built:**

- Complete GraphRAG agent with three retriever tools
- Conversational interface to all retriever capabilities from previous modules
- Intelligent tool selection for optimal answers

**Your Journey:**

- ✅ **Knowledge Graph Creation:** PDF to Knowledge Graph pipeline
- ✅ **Retriever Development:** Built three different retrievers
- ✅ **Agent Tools:** Converted retrievers to conversational agent tools

**Final Result:** A complete GraphRAG agent that can answer any question using the most appropriate retrieval strategy automatically!
