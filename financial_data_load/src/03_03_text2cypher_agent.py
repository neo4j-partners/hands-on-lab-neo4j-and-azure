Multi-Tool Agent with Text2Cypher

This workshop demonstrates an agent with three tools: schema retrieval,
vector search, and natural language to Cypher queries using the Microsoft
Agent Framework with Microsoft Foundry (V2 SDK - azure-ai-projects) and
neo4j-graphrag-python.

Run with: uv run python solutions/02_03_text2cypher_agent.py

# Custom prompt for Cypher generation with modern Cypher best practices
CYPHER_PROMPT: Final[str] = """Task: Generate a Cypher statement to query a graph database.

Instructions:
- Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
- Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
- Only filter by name when a specific entity name is mentioned in the question.
  When filtering by name, use case-insensitive matching:
  `WHERE toLower(node.name) CONTAINS toLower('ActualEntityName')`
- Do NOT add name filters if no specific entity name is mentioned in the question.

Modern Cypher Requirements:
- Use `elementId(node)` instead of `id(node)` (id() is removed in Neo4j 5+).
- Use `count{{pattern}}` instead of `size((pattern))` for counting patterns.
- Use `EXISTS {{MATCH pattern}}` instead of `exists((pattern))` for existence checks.
- When using ORDER BY, filter NULL values first: `WHERE property IS NOT NULL ORDER BY property`.
- Use explicit grouping with WITH clauses for aggregations.
- Limit collected results when appropriate: `collect(item)[0..20]`.

Schema:
{schema}

Note: Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement.
Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement.

The question is:
