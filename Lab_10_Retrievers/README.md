# Lab 10 - Advanced Retrievers

> **Advanced Lab** - This lab builds on the core workshop (Labs 4-9) with more advanced retrieval techniques.

This lab covers natural language querying, entity extraction, and working with the complete dataset. You'll use Text2Cypher to convert questions into Cypher queries, build graphs through entity extraction, and see GraphRAG results improve with more data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- Completed **Lab 0** (Azure sign-in)
- Completed **Lab 1** (Neo4j Aura setup)
- Completed **Lab 4** (Codespace setup with environment variables configured)
- Completed **Lab 8** (Knowledge graph built with embeddings)
- Completed **Lab 9** (Advanced Agents)

## Lab Overview

This lab consists of three notebooks:

### 01_text2cypher_retriever.ipynb - Text2Cypher Retriever
Use natural language to query your graph directly:
- Automatically convert natural language questions to Cypher queries
- Query specific nodes, relationships, and properties without writing Cypher
- Understand the graph schema and how it guides query generation
- Build accessible natural language interfaces to your knowledge graph

### 02_entity_extraction.ipynb - Entity Extraction
Extract structured entities and relationships from text:
- Learn the difference between lexical and semantic graphs
- Define a schema with entity and relationship types
- Use `SimpleKGPipeline` to extract entities from text
- Query the combined graph (chunks + entities)

### 03_full_dataset.ipynb - Working with the Full Dataset
Load the complete SEC 10-K dataset and explore richer results:
- Load pre-built knowledge graph with multiple company filings
- See improved search results with more data
- Explore the expanded entity and relationship network

## Getting Started

1. Open the first notebook: `01_text2cypher_retriever.ipynb`
2. Work through each notebook in order
3. Each notebook builds on the previous one

### Running Locally

If you prefer to run the labs from the terminal instead of notebooks, first ensure everything is set up properly:

```bash
uv run setup_env.py
```

Then run the workshop menu:

```bash
cd financial_data_load && uv run python main.py solutions
```

Menu items 5, 6, and 7 correspond to notebooks 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Text2Cypher Retriever**: Converts natural language questions into Cypher queries for precise, fact-based answers
- **Entity Extraction**: Using LLMs to identify companies, products, services, and relationships from text
- **Knowledge Graph**: Combined structure of documents, chunks, and extracted entities
- **GraphRAG**: A pipeline that combines retrievers with LLMs to generate contextual answers grounded in your knowledge graph

## Next Steps

After completing this lab, continue to [Lab 11 - Hybrid Search](../Lab_11_Hybrid_Search) to learn how to combine keyword and semantic search for improved retrieval accuracy.
