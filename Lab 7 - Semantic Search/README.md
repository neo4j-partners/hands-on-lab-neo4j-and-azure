# Lab 7 - Semantic Search
In this lab, you will learn about semantic search and how a knowledge graph in Neo4j, combined with text embeddings from Azure ML, can be leveraged for fast and effective knowledge retrieval.  We will add text documents from 10-K filings to our graph to demonstrate these capabilities.

Step through these two notebooks in order to complete the lab.  Run them in Azure ML as we did before.

* [01-text-embedding.ipynb](01-text-embedding.ipynb) - Use text embedding service on 10-K filings.
* [02-semantic-search.ipynb](02-semantic-search.ipynb) - Demonstrates knowledge retrieval with connected data (multiple hops from documents) using vector search and graph traversals in Cypher.
