    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",

    "\n",
    "When building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, we split documents into smaller pieces called **chunks**. This is necessary because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context windows are limited** - LLMs can only process a certain amount of text at once\n",
    "2. **Retrieval precision** - Smaller chunks allow more precise matching to user queries\n",
    "3. **Cost efficiency** - Processing smaller chunks is faster and cheaper\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph structure we'll build:\n",
