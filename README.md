# hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-azure
Neo4j is the [leading graph database](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms) vendor.  We've worked closely with Microsoft Azure engineering for years.  Our products, AuraDB and AuraDS are offered as managed services on Azure.  Neo4j Aura Professional Edition is offered in the [Azure Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#create/neo4j.neo4j_aura_professional).

In this hands-on lab, you'll learn about Neo4j, Microsoft Foundry, and the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework). The lab is designed for data scientists, data engineers, and AI developers who want to master GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques and build production-ready agentic AI applications.

In today's landscape, organizations need AI systems that can extract deep insights from unstructured documents, understand complex entity relationships, and build intelligent systems that can autonomously reason over vast information networks. This hands-on lab addresses this need directly by providing mastery in the most powerful pattern available for complex document intelligence: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG).

You'll work with a real-world dataset of SEC 10-K company filings to learn fundamental GraphRAG patterns. We'll start by building a knowledge graph from unstructured text using generative AI for entity extraction. Then you'll implement multiple retrieval strategies: vector similarity search for semantic retrieval, graph-enhanced retrievers that leverage entity relationships, and natural language to Cypher query generation. Finally, you'll build intelligent agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework that can autonomously reason over your knowledge graph to answer complex questions.

By the end of this lab, you'll have hands-on experience with:
- Building knowledge graphs from unstructured documents
- Implementing semantic search with vector embeddings
- Creating graph-enhanced retrieval patterns for richer context
- Developing agentic AI systems that combine multiple tools and reasoning strategies
- Deploying GraphRAG applications on Azure infrastructure

These techniques apply to any domain where you need to extract insights from documents, understand entity relationships, and build AI systems that can reason over complex information networks.

## Knowledge Graph Data Model

The workshop builds a hybrid knowledge graph that combines **lexical structure** (documents and chunks) with **semantic knowledge** (entities and relationships extracted by LLM). This architecture enables multiple retrieval strategies.

### Graph Structure

### Node Types

| Node Label | Description | Key Properties |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `Document` | Source PDF file | `path`, `createdAt` |
| `Chunk` | Text segment from document | `text`, `index`, `embedding` (1536-dim vector) |
| `Company` | Extracted company entity | `name`, `ticker` |
| `Product` | Products/services mentioned | `name` |
| `RiskFactor` | Business risks identified | `name` |
| `Executive` | Key personnel | `name`, `title` |
| `FinancialMetric` | Financial data points | `name`, `value` |
| `AssetManager` | Institutional investors | `managerName` |

### Relationship Types

| Relationship | Direction | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `FROM_DOCUMENT` | `(Chunk)->(Document)` | Links chunk to source document |
| `NEXT_CHUNK` | `(Chunk)->(Chunk)` | Sequential chunk ordering |
| `FROM_CHUNK` | `(Entity)->(Chunk)` | Provenance: where entity was extracted |
| `FACES_RISK` | `(Company)->(RiskFactor)` | Company faces this risk |
| `OFFERS` | `(Company)->(Product)` | Company offers this product |
| `HAS_EXECUTIVE` | `(Company)->(Executive)` | Company has this executive |
| `REPORTS` | `(Company)->(FinancialMetric)` | Company reports this metric |
| `OWNS` | `(AssetManager)->(Company)` | Investor owns shares in company |

### Search Indexes

The data pipeline creates three indexes to support different retrieval strategies:

| Index Name | Type | Target | Purpose |
|------------|------|--------|---------|
| `chunkEmbeddings` | Vector | `Chunk.embedding` | Semantic similarity search |
| `chunkText` | Fulltext | `Chunk.text` | Keyword search for hybrid retrieval |
| `search_entities` | Fulltext | Entity `.name` properties | Entity lookup by name |

### Retrieval Strategies

**1. Vector Search** - Find semantically similar content using embeddings:
```cypher
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('chunkEmbeddings', 5, $embedding)
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.text, score
```

**2. Graph-Enhanced Retrieval** - Combine vector search with graph traversal:
```cypher
-- Find chunks, then traverse to related entities
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('chunkEmbeddings', 5, $embedding)
YIELD node AS chunk, score
MATCH (company:Company)-[:FROM_CHUNK]->(chunk)
OPTIONAL MATCH (company)-[:FACES_RISK]->(risk:RiskFactor)
RETURN chunk.text, company.name, collect(risk.name) AS risks
```

**3. Hybrid Search** - Combine keyword and semantic search:
```cypher
-- Uses both chunkEmbeddings (vector) and chunkText (fulltext) indexes
-- Alpha parameter controls the balance: 1.0 = pure vector, 0.0 = pure keyword
```

**4. Text2Cypher** - Natural language to Cypher query generation using LLM.

This hybrid architecture enables rich, context-aware retrieval that leverages both the semantic understanding from embeddings and the structural relationships in the knowledge graph.
