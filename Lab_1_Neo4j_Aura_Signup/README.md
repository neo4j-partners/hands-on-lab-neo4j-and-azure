# Lab 1: Neo4j Aura Setup and Exploration

In this lab, you will set up your Neo4j Aura database on Azure Marketplace, restore the knowledge graph from a backup, explore your graph visually, and build an AI-powered agent using Aura Agent.

## Prerequisites

- Completed **Lab 0** (Azure sign-in)
- Access to Azure Portal

## Part 1: Neo4j Aura Signup

Follow the instructions in [Neo4j_Aura_Signup.md](Neo4j_Aura_Signup.md) to:

1. Subscribe to Neo4j Aura through Azure Marketplace
2. Create your Neo4j Aura account
3. Configure and provision your database instance
4. Save your connection credentials

## Part 2: Restore the Backup

After your Aura instance is running, restore the pre-built knowledge graph:

1. Go to your instance in the [Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io)
2. Click the **...** menu on your instance and select **Backup & restore**

   **Use the pre-built backup file**
   - Drag the file `finance_data.backup` from the `data/` folder in this lab

4. Wait for the restore to complete - your instance will restart with the SEC 10-K filings knowledge graph

The backup contains:
- SEC 10-K filing documents from major companies (Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, etc.)
- Extracted entities: Companies, Risk Factors, Products, Executives, Financial Metrics
- Asset manager ownership data
- Text chunks with vector embeddings for semantic search

## Part 3: Explore the Knowledge Graph

Follow [EXPLORE.md](EXPLORE.md) to:

1. Use Neo4j Explore to visually navigate your graph
2. Search for patterns between asset managers, companies, and risk factors
3. Apply graph algorithms like Degree Centrality
4. Identify key entities through visual analysis

## Part 4: Build an Aura Agent

Follow [AURA_AGENTS.md](AURA_AGENTS.md) to:

1. Create an AI-powered agent using Neo4j Aura Agent
2. Configure Cypher template tools for SEC filings analysis
3. Add semantic search capabilities
4. Enable natural language to Cypher translation
5. Test your agent with sample questions

## Next Steps

After completing this lab, continue to Lab 2 to set up your development environment and learn how to build GraphRAG applications programmatically.
